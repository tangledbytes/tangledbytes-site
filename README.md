# Site for Notes
I have had multiple sites in the past like:
- Sagacious Dev main site
- Sagacious Dev blog site
- Sagacious Dev notes site

It is too much and now that I am no longer "sagacious" and rather entangled into a bunch of stuff, I'd rather tangle everything into one site, [TangledBytes](https://tangledbytes.com).

The site has:
1. Blogs - All the blogs that I write.
2. Notes - Some of the notes that I want to be able to publish to the internet.
3. Tags - For me to quickly select all of the notes/blogs that have the same tag.
4. Search - This is crucial. Dumping notes is important but being able to search through them easily is also very important and that's why unlike the blog site, this site has a WASM based search functionality built into it.

This UI/UX of the the site is somewhat inspired from [https://devinschulz.com/](https://devinschulz.com/).

This blog uses:
1. Hugo for static side generation.
2. Sass for stylesheets (only because hugo has apparently better support for sass than for good old css).
3. [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for searches.
4. Katex for Latex rendering.
